This repo is following the tutorial created by "javidx9" 
`OneLoneCoder.com - 3D Graphics Part #1 - Triangles &amp; Projections "Tredimensjonal Grafikk" - @Javidx9`

This code is mostly _not mine_. I may deviate slightly from the tutorial; however, the concepts and code used in this repo are a product of the wonderful "javidx9". If you fork / clone this repo (for whatever reason you would ever do that) please give credit to our friend, javid.
